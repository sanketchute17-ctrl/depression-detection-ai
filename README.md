# AI Based Depression Detection
Building AI course project

## Summary
This project proposes an AI system that detects early signs of depression using text messages and user behaviour patterns. The goal is to alert users and suggest help resources before the condition becomes severe.

## Background
Depression is one of the most common mental health problems among students and young adults. Many people do not realize they are developing depression until it becomes serious.

Problems:
- People ignore early symptoms
- Lack of mental health awareness
- Fear of talking to others
- Shortage of psychologists

## How is it used?
1. User writes thoughts in the app
2. AI analyzes emotional tone
3. System warns user if risk detected
4. Suggests help resources

## Data sources and AI methods
- User text input
- NLP sentiment analysis
- Machine learning classification

## Challenges
AI cannot replace a doctor and predictions may not always be correct.

## What next?
Future versions may include voice emotion detection and counselor connection.
