AI Based Depression Detection

Building AI course project

Summary

This project proposes an AI system that detects early signs of depression using text messages and user behaviour patterns. The goal is to alert users and suggest help resources before the condition becomes severe.

Background

Depression is one of the most common mental health problems among students and young adults. Many people do not realize they are developing depression until it becomes serious.

Problems:

People ignore early symptoms

Lack of mental health awareness

Fear of talking to others

Shortage of psychologists

My motivation is that many students around me feel stressed but never seek help. Early detection can prevent serious mental health issues and even suicides. Therefore, an AI-based early warning system can be very helpful.

How is it used?

User types messages or journals thoughts in the app

AI analyzes emotional tone and behaviour pattern

If depression risk is detected, system alerts the user

App suggests coping tips and helpline resources

Users:

Students

Young professionals

Anyone feeling mentally stressed

The system works privately on a mobile app or website.

Data sources and AI methods
Data Sources

User text input (journals or chats)

Usage behaviour (sleep time, activity frequency – optional)

Public mental health text datasets

AI Techniques

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Sentiment Analysis

Text Classification model

Machine Learning risk scoring

The AI learns patterns such as negative words, hopeless expressions, and emotional tone changes over time.

Challenges

AI cannot replace a doctor

Wrong prediction may occur

Privacy concerns with personal data

Cultural language differences affect accuracy

The system should only assist — not diagnose.

What next?

Future improvements:

Voice emotion detection

Wearable smartwatch integration

Direct connection to counselors

Multilingual support

Emergency alert for high-risk cases
